# clforms
**Pseudographics interface for console window by .Net Core 3.1**

**Attention!**
_After I finished making the project and was ready to put it on github, I was horrified to find that all the comments and summary in the code were written in Russian. I am currently rewriting comments file by file and will be adding them here soon_

Some examples about what I did by clforms:
